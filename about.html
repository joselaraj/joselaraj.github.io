                    Hello everyone! My name is Jose Lara, I am a current Computer Science student at Elgin Community College. I have experience with C++, I am currently learning  HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
                    During my time in the Engineering Tech Club at my school, I contributed to the team by writing code for the competition robot we built. 
                     It had different functions such as driving forward, reverse, steering, deploying its wings and controlling the arm attachment. 
                </p>
